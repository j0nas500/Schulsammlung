# Without language, No knowledge
Good German language skill are not implicitness in the Herbert-Hoover-School where 90 percent are immigrants. So the School require that also in the Breaks and class trips German is required to talk in German. Supporter thinks that this is the solution for the end of all integrationproblems. Critics say the limitation of the language limit the personal right and warn for a discrimination. An other way chooses the Heinrich-Wolgast-School in Hamburg. It is an German-Turkish school. So the lessons will be in Turkish and German. The Experience show if a German guy coming to a turkey group they change the language from Turkish automatically in German because then is no exclusion. The Pedagogy critic the Berliner school, that the require to talk in German would not esteem the native language and identity. But the most not-german parents would be support this concept. They see the requirements for a good school qualification for the kids and more equality of opportunity in the education system. If anyone don´t talk in german their wouldn´t be any punishment because we wouldn´t discriminated their native language.
